The original file is a severely distorted and unofficial version of the GitHub Acceptable Use Policies, invalidated by a future timestamp, numerous spelling and grammatical errors, and nonsensical terms ('imaginary employees', 'meteorology'). The tone is unprofessional and legally vague. The corrected version professionalizes the language, removes fabricated content, and clarifies ambiguous phrasing to align with standard policy document conventions. For full compliance, the official GitHub policy should be used as the authoritative source.
