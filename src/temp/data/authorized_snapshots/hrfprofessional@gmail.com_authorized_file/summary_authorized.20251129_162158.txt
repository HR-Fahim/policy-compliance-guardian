The original document was identified as an unofficial and heavily distorted version of the GitHub Acceptable Use Policy, containing numerous errors and informal language. It has been replaced with a corrected, professional version that accurately reflects the official GitHub Acceptable Use Policy, based on verified public sources. The corrected version includes properly structured sections on user safety, intellectual property, spam, platform integrity, and other key areas, while removing all non-existent and nonsensical clauses.
