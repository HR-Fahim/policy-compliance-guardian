The original file 'fake_policy.txt' was identified as an inauthentic and heavily corrupted version of the GitHub Acceptable Use Policies. It contained widespread spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and unprofessional language, rendering it invalid. The file has been corrected to reflect a professional and standard policy. The title and headings were fixed, the informal 'Short Note' was replaced with a proper introduction, and the legally ambiguous and nonsensical rules under 'Compliance with Laws and Regulations' and 'User Safety' were rewritten to be clear, professional, and aligned with standard acceptable use provisions.
